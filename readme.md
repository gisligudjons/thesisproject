# Title: Symbolic Acts For Action; Investing In Sustainable Futures

## Abstract

All around the world, countries are witnessing the different effects of climate change. The island nation of Tuvalu, which is home to around 11,000 people, has witnessed sea levels rise by about 0.5 centimeters every year since 1993. The Maldives, a well-known bucket list getaway, is the lowest-lying nation in the world. Therefore, sea-level rise caused by global climate change is an existential threat to the island nation. Finally, Iceland, a cold island nation in the Atlantic ocean actually has the opposite problem. Land in Iceland is rising at a pace of as much as 1.4 inches per year in certain areas as a result of climate change, according to a new study. Like the rest of the world, these countries have much to gain from a better, more sustainable, and climate friendly world. A main combatant in the fight is sustainable development, which has increased emphasis and interest, both from investors and the public, in sustainable and responsible investments. This study attempts to answer questions about the current state of sustainable development on a global scale. The study therefore aims to inform the reader as to how their country’s standing in sustainable development lies.
